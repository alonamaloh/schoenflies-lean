The face of the enlarged graph through a point of an old face is a component of *that old

/-- **The realisation of a walk with polygonal edges is a polyline from its source to its
target.** The induction is along the walk: the first edge contributes its own vertex list, and
the two lists are joined at the waypoint, which is the last vertex of the first and the first
vertex of the rest. -/

/-! ## The realisation of a cycle is a separating curve

This is the composition the base case of `lem:face-cycles` needs, and the one thing that was
missing from it: `Graph.IsDrawing.cycle_isJordanCurve` says the realisation is a Jordan curve
and `Graph.IsDrawing.isPolygonal_edgesCover` says it is polygonal, and
`Schoenflies.exists_closedPolygon` — the realization theorem — turns that pair into a
`Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon`, whose carrier `Schoenflies.ClosedPolygon.isSeparating_carrier`
knows to separate the plane. Nothing here inspects the polygon; it is used and discarded. -/

/-- Going round the cycle the other way: the edge, then the detour, is a closed walk at the
edge's far end. This is the walk whose edge list is `e :: D`, the list every statement about
the realisation of a cycle is phrased with. -/

/-- **The realisation of a cycle of a polygonal plane graph is a separating Jordan curve.**
`Schoenflies.IsSeparating` is Definition 2.4: the complement has exactly two regions, one
bounded and one unbounded, each with the curve as its boundary. -/

cycle*". The cycle is a parameter rather than an existential so that a consumer that has
