# Realizing an edge subdivision

`Schoenflies/GeneratedStructure.lean` performs the *abstract* edge subdivision
(`CellStructure.subdivideEdge`) and states what it means for a realization of the subdivided
structure to refine a realization of the old one (`SubdivData.IsRefinement`);
`Schoenflies/CellulationInvariants.lean` propagates assertions (i), (iv) and (vii) across such a
refinement. Nothing built such a realization. This module does.

The construction is the blueprint's own sentence — "the corresponding point is inserted into the
corresponding edge using the edge parametrization" — made into data: pick a parameter
`t ∈ (0,1)`, put the new 0-cell at `R.drawing d.edge t`, and draw the two new 1-cells with the
two halves of the old parametrization, each rescaled to `[0,1]`.

## The orientation of the drawn edge

`IsDrawing.edge_param` is deliberately orientation-free: it says
`G.IsLink e (drawing e 0) (drawing e 1)`, so `drawing d.edge 0` may be *either* `pos d.left` or
`pos d.right`. But `d.newEdge₁` runs from `d.left` to `d.newVertex` by definition of
`subdivideEdge`, so which half of the parametrization draws it is not fixed in advance.

Assuming `drawing d.edge 0 = pos d.left` would be a false hypothesis for half of all inputs, and
the caller cannot repair it (swapping `d.left` with `d.right` in the `SubdivData` also swaps the
two new edge *names*, producing a different abstract structure). So the orientation is read off
instead: `SubdivData.leftParam` is the endpoint parameter, `0` or `1`, at which the drawn edge
sits at `d.left`. Every statement below is orientation-free; only the two lemmas
`SubdivData.drawing_leftParam` and `SubdivData.drawing_rightParam` look inside.

Because of that, the construction is phrased with `Schoenflies.subarc` — the general affine
reparametrization already on `main` — rather than with `firstHalf` / `secondHalf`, which are the
two halves in the standard orientation and are recorded here as the named special case.

## No side conditions

`SubdivData.realize` takes no geometric hypothesis beyond `t ∈ Ioo 0 1`. Everything else it
needs — that `d.edge` is drawn, injectively and continuously, between the positions of `d.left`
and `d.right`, and that an interior point of a drawn edge is not a vertex — is already carried by
`CellStructure.Realization`, and is extracted here rather than assumed.

## Blueprint

* `def:generated-structure`, operation 1 (edge subdivision) — the geometric half of the
  operation, whose abstract half is `CellStructure.subdivideEdge`.
* `lem:cellulation-invariants` (i) and (iv), the paragraph "Suppose first that an open edge `e`
  is subdivided at a new vertex `v`": `SubdivData.isRefinement_realize` produces exactly the
  hypotheses that `SubdivData.IsRefinement.isCellDecomposition_and_isFaceJordan` consumes.

Declarations:

* `Schoenflies.uIcc_union_uIcc`, `Schoenflies.uIcc_inter_uIcc` — a parameter interval cut at an
  interior point.
* `Schoenflies.subarc_image_union`, `Schoenflies.subarc_image_inter` — the two subarcs of a cut
  cover the arc and meet exactly at the cut point.
* `Schoenflies.firstHalf`, `Schoenflies.secondHalf` — the two halves of a drawn edge in the
  standard orientation, with their endpoint values, continuity, injectivity, images, meet and
  union.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.leftParam` / `rightParam` — the orientation of the drawn
  edge.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.realize` — the realization of the subdivided structure.
* `Schoenflies.CellStructure.SubdivData.isRefinement_realize` — it refines the given one.
